# wolverinepy ~ a python code playground for the cs-lab

i've decided that i  want to make a flask app in python to make a small window for which i can code python on the domain i just bought called 'wolverinepy.com'; i want to make it into a code playground using the 'Brython' plug- in. i heard about it thru my favorite python YouTuber 'Sentdex'; he uses it on his site "pythonprogramming.net'.

the goal of this site is for me to have fun expounding on my python programming and web building skills learned @UVU during my sophomore year (Fall17-Spring18). the application of this project will be something i can donate to the school and maintain as a way to get students in the CS-1400 classes excited about the fact that in 1 year they could be building cool programms too; more importantly as a CS tutor who works in the online lab id like to create a way to share the playground and as a kind of 2way mirror that other students can uses to write in 2 side by side windows that students cant copy paste out of , but can paste into. in this way they could type in one windo on their screen, and ill bable to see it on my screen, and visa versa, when i write into my window they can see it but cannot 'highlight/copy' out of it... in this way accademic cheating is not possible, only the exchange of live coding.

this is a rough idea but a neat one that i think i can find most of the pieces out on the web. this will be one of my summer ambitions.
